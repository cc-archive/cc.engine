cc.engine provides the Creative Commons license engine along with a set of
related scripts. The scripts can be used for generating static versions of
the license deeds.


ccEngine
========

The ccEngine is comprised of the following repositories:

* cc.api_: *Legacy API to integrate the Creative Commons licensing engine into
  third party applications*
* cc.engine_ (this repository): *Python app that runs part of the license
  engine on CC's website*
* cc.i18n_: *Localization data for CC's deeds and license chooser*
* cc.license_: *Python app that runs part of the license engine on CC's
  website*
* cc.licenserdf_: *RDF describing Creative Commons licenses*
* rdfadict_: *An RDFa parser wth a simple dictionary-like interface.*

ccEngine is primarlily a Python project with 106 Python files (87.6%) across its repositories. The Python files contain:

* 7,315 lines of code (51.4%)
* 2,481 lines of comments (17.4%)

WARNING
=======

Much of the documentation associated with this project is no longer accurate!


Installation
============

NOTE: Unless you are installing this in ``Development Mode``, you will need to
run ``sudo ./bin/buildout`` (with root privileges), because the script needs to
create directories in ``/etc`` and ``/var``.

cc.engine uses `zc.buildout <http://python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to
assemble the software and its dependencies. For example ::

  $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

After the buildout process completes the application may be started using
the generated init script ::

  # /etc/init.d/cc_engine-run-cc_engine start

You can prevent the service from detaching from the console as a daemon with
the ``fg`` argument (instead of ``start'') ::

  # /etc/init.d/cc_engine-run-cc_engine fg

If you get a UnicodeDecodeError from the cc.engine (you'll see this if it's
running in the foreground) when you try to access the http://host:9080/license/
then it's likely that the install of python you are using is set to use ASCII
as it's default output.  You can change this to UTF-8 by creating the file
/usr/lib/python<version>/sitecustomize.py and adding these lines:

  import sys
  sys.setdefaultencoding("utf-8")


Development Mode
----------------

If you are working on developing cc.engine, a special buildout configuration
is provided.  This configuration differs from the default in the following
ways:

* Zope is configured to run in ``devmode``.
* A XXX report is generated at time of buildout.

You can build cc.engine for development by specifying the buildout configuration
on the command line ::

  $ ./bin/buildout -c dev.buildout.cfg


Building lxml + Dependencies
----------------------------

cc.engine relies of `lxml <http://codespeak.net/lxml>`_, which is a Python
wrapper for libxml2 and libxslt1. If you system has older versions of these
libraries installed, cc.engine may fail with ``Unknown symbol`` errors. A
specialized buildout configuration is provided to download and build a
local version of libxml2, libxslt1 and lxml if needed. To use this, specify
the configuration on the command line ::

  $ ./bin/buildout -c lxml.buildout.cfg

Note that this builds in production mode.
